    "### Purpose of Grid Search CV\n",
    "Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validates each, and determines which combination gives the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **Define Parameter Grid**: Specify the hyperparameters and the range of values to explore.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation**: For each combination of hyperparameters, perform cross-validation on the training data.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**: Calculate the average performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) across the cross-validation folds.\n",
    "4. **Select Best Parameters**: Choose the combination of hyperparameters that yields the best cross-validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exhaustively searching through the specified parameter grid, Grid Search CV helps in selecting the most effective model configuration.\n"

    "- **Approach**: Exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the specified grid.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Ensures the optimal combination is found within the specified range.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially with large parameter grids.\n",

    "### Randomized Search CV\n",
    "- **Approach**: Evaluates a random subset of the possible hyperparameter combinations.\n",
